# Logical Grouping

> since v3.5

By default, when multiple field parameters are used in a search, the relationship between these parameters is **AND**. So, how can we express **OR** and more complex **logical combinations** between **AND** and **OR**?

Finally, in `v3.5.0`, Bean Searcher introduced the logical grouping feature. Its main ideas are as follows:

* Group field parameters by prefixing them with a **group name** (the default separator between the group name and the field parameter is `.`, and the group name can consist of letters and numbers).
* Use a new parameter, the **logical expression**, to represent the logical relationship between groups (the default parameter name is `gexpr`, which is a shorthand for `Group Expression`).

## Usage Examples

When passing parameters, divide them into groups `A`, `B`, and `C`:

```properties
# Group A: Name is Jack, case-insensitive, and is male
A.name = Jack
A.name-ic = true
A.gender = Male
# Group B: Name is Alice, and is female
B.name = Alice
B.gender = Female
# Group C: Age is greater than or equal to 20
C.age = 20
C.age-op = ge 
```

Then, pass a new parameter, the group expression `gexpr`, to represent the logical relationship between the three groups:

```properties
# Group expression: (A or B) and C
gexpr = (A|B)&C
```

This represents a more complex query condition: (a male with the name Jack (case-insensitive) or a female with the name Alice) and the age is greater than or equal to 20.

### Written as URL Parameters

```txt
?A.name=Jack&A.name-ic=true&A.gender=Male&B.name=Alice&B.gender=Female&C.age=20&C.age-op=ge&gexpr=(A%7CB)%26C
```

::: tip Note
Since `&` and `|` are special characters, the value of the parameter `gexpr` needs to be **URLEncoded** in the URL.

### Using the Parameter Builder

We can also use the parameter builder to express the same logical relationship:

```java
Map<String, Object> params = MapUtils.builder()
        .group("A")             // Start of Group A
        .field(User::getName, "Jack").ic()
        .field(User::getGender, "Male")
        .group("B")             // Start of Group B
        .field(User::getName, "Alice")
        .field(User::getGender, "Female")
        .group("C")             // Start of Group C
        .field(User::getAge, "20").op(GreateEqual.class)
        .groupExpr("(A|B)&C")   // Inter-group logical relationship (group expression)
        .build();
```

Since `v4.3.0`, the parameter builder has added the `and(..)` and `or(..)` methods, which can more conveniently build logical groupings. So, the above code is also equivalent to:

```java
Map<String, Object> params = MapUtils.builder()
        .or(o -> o
            .and(a -> a
                .field(User::getName, "Jack").ic()
                .field(User::getGender, "Male")
            )
            .and(a -> a
                .field(User::getName, "Alice")
                .field(User::getGender, "Female")
            )
        )
        .field(User::getAge, "20").op(GreateEqual.class)
        .build();
// There is no need to call the groupExpr(..) method. The and(..) and or(..) methods will automatically generate group names and group expressions.
```

::: tip Hint
Only [field parameters](/en/guide/param/field) and [custom SQL conditions](/en/guide/param/sql) can be grouped. [Pagination parameters](/en/guide/param/page), [sorting parameters](/en/guide/param/sort), [embedded parameters](/en/guide/param/embed), and [Select parameters](/en/guide/param/select) cannot be grouped.

## Logical Expressions

As seen above, a logical expression is a formula composed of **group names**, **logical operators** (OR `|`, AND `&`), and **parentheses** to represent the logical relationship between groups of field parameters.

It can be very simple or nested multiple layers. For example:

* When it is empty, it means the parameters are not grouped.
* It can consist of a single group name. For example, `A` represents the conditions of Group A.
* `A|B` means A or B.
* `A&B` means A and B.
* `(A&(B|C)|D)&F` is also a valid nested logical expression.
* There can be spaces between group names, logical operators, and parentheses.
* Parts of the expression other than logical operators, parentheses, and spaces will be regarded as group names.
* When the left and right parentheses do not match, it will be regarded as an illegal expression, such as `(A&B`.
* Illegal expressions will output a warning during the search and will be ignored by the search.

::: warning Note
The group expression cannot contain the `$` symbol because it is a built-in group (root group) in the framework. If the expression contains the `$` symbol, it will be regarded as invalid and ignored. Refer to the [Root Parameters](#root-parameters-since-v3-8-0) section.

### Logical Priority

* The priority of the logical operator **AND** is higher than that of **OR**.

For example, `A | B & C` is equivalent to `A | (B & C)`.

### Intelligent Simplification

Bean Searcher also has a built-in optimizer. When your logical expression is redundant and complex, it will automatically optimize it to the simplest form, thereby simplifying the final generated SQL statement.

For example:

Original Expression | Optimized
-|-
`(( A ))` | `A`
`A & A & A` | `A`
`A \| A \| A` | `A`
`A & ( A \| B )` | `A`
`A \| ( A & B )` | `A`
`A \| ( B \| C )` | `A \| B \| C`
`A & ( B & C )` | `A & B & C`
`(A \| B & (( C \| (D \| E))) & D) \| (F)` | `A \| B & D \| F`
`A \| (A \| C) & B & (A \| D)` | `A \| D & C & B`

### Expression Merging (since v4.3.0)

Sometimes, the front-end passes a group expression parameter, but the back-end also uses the `groupExpr(..)` method to specify a new expression. In this case, which expression should be used? Before `v4.3.0`, the expression specified by the back-end would overwrite the expression specified by the front-end.

Since `v4.3.0`, users can choose whether to **overwrite** or **merge** (the default behavior after v4.3.0, see the `bean-searcher.params.group.mergeable` configuration in the [Configuration Items](#configuration-items)) these two expressions.

#### Merging Rules

Merge with an **AND** relationship. For example, if the front-end passes the expression `A|B` and the back-end uses the `groupExpr(..)` method to specify the expression `A|C`, the final expression will be `(A|B)&(A|C)`.

## Root Parameters (since v3.8.0)

When a group expression is specified, all **field parameters** that are not in the groups specified by the expression will be ignored by the searcher. For example:

```properties
# Group A
A.name = Jack
# Field parameter outside the group, will be ignored when gexpr is non-empty and valid
age = 20
# Group expression
gexpr = A
```

However, sometimes the group expression `gexpr` needs to be specified by the front-end, and the back-end also needs to inject some parameters that **cannot be ignored**. What should be done in this case? Just inject an additional root group (represented by `$`) parameter:

```properties
# Field parameter outside the group, valid when gexpr is empty or invalid
age = 20
# Root group parameter, valid when gexpr is non-empty and valid
$.age = 20
```

Group `$` is a built-in group in the framework, and its relationship with `gexpr` is always `AND`.

To ensure that a field parameter is not ignored, we must inject two parameters into the search parameters (such as `age` and `$.age` above), which is a bit cumbersome. Therefore, in `v3.8.0`, the parameter builder was enhanced so that its `field(..)` method will automatically add the corresponding root parameter before a group is **explicitly specified**. For example:

```java
Map<String, Object> params = MapUtils.builder()
        // Call the field method before explicitly specifying a group
        .field(User::getAge, 20) 
        // Equivalent to the following two lines of code:
        //   .put("age", 20) 
        //   .put("$.age", 20) 
        .group("A")
        // Call the field method after explicitly specifying a group
        .field(User::getName, "Jack") 
        // Only equivalent to:
        //   .put("A.name", "Jack")
        .build()
```

So, when the back-end needs to manually add search conditions, we recommend using the parameter builder.

## Configuration Items

When using the `bean-searcher-boot-starter` dependency, we can use the following configuration keys to customize:

Configuration Key Name | Meaning | Optional Values | Default Value
